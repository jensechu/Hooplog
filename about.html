<p>My name is Jensen Hussey, and I like to hoop.</p>

<p>Before I started to hoop I was a disciplined belly dancer. A friend of mine that I originally belly danced with introduced me to her hoops a little over a year ago in October 2010 and since then I refuse to put them down... unless it's cold outside because I vehemently hate the cold. Currently I am merging my two dance loves into one to create a verbosely unique personal style.</p>

<p>Another spectrum of my hooping life is crafting hoops. I am very particular about which size/weight hoop I use for any given trick. Of course I have all-purpose hoops, but I tend to bond with the certain flow of each hoop when I execute something specific. My biggest craft projects are currently: an especially lightweight fire hoop with six torches, and a centimeter in tube diameter with a heavily weighted hoop- probably made out of metal. </p>

<p>Aside from hooping I have a job as a web developer. I made this site myself, and I am very proud of it! I also enjoy the Dune series, pokemon, and my PSP.</p>
